# Microfrontend

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! This is a demo for an Angular 17 application with dynamic microfrontends: based on the package **@angular-architects/module-federation** an **@nx**, the microfrontend applications will be dynamically loaded in two ways through the router and using dynamic rendering of exposed components.
This demo has focus on architecture, so no tests and no particular styles are implemented.

## Structure

**Application Shell**: loads dynamically two microfrontend applications using both routes and single standalone components; it provides a proxy to access the assets of the microfrontends.

**mfe1** and **mfe2**: applications that expose routes and a standalone component to be loaded by the shell;

**mfe-common**: library that allow to share components and classes between all the applications;

## Start

-   Install dependencies with npm
-   Run Micro Frontend 1 with the following command `ng serve mfe1 -o`
-   Run Micro Frontend 2 with the following command `ng serve mfe2 -o`
-   Run the shell (the application that hosts the microfrontend applications. Be sure to run the shell last) with the following command `ng serve shell -o`

## Lint

Run `npm run eslint` to run the ES lint.

Run `npm run eslint:fix` to run the ES lint and apply fixes.
